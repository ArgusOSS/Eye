### Rules and guidelines

We welcome contributors with any level of skillset and education to come in and help us put together Eye. We advise you to follow the following set of rules to keep in mind while contributing to our Eye:

1. Please get approval on an issue from a maintainer before starting to work on it.
2. Since we are still in the very nascent stage of our project, We strongly advise you to join our discord server to get involved in the development cycle: https://discord.gg/DJyMGArg8D
3. Please make sure that your PR follows the linting rules that our pre-commit hook enforces.
4. Please make sure that your branch, whether you're a maintainer using this repository itself or a fork should use the format `username/feature` for your branches. So, If my branch where I am working on the auth feature should look like: `0x0elliot/auth`
5. Your PR should be to the `dev` branch.
