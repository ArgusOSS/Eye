# Eye 

One dashboard to debug in a multi-cloud environment while being able to manage projects and get statistics over how much your services have gone down in the past with detailed API response time.

Here is the <a href="https://eye-three.vercel.app/">demo</a> instance for this project! Backend would be plugged in soon to this.

## Docker set-up

```
cp .env_template .env
docker-compose up
```

## Frontend Setup

```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn run dev
```


## Progress as of now:

We are done with the foundation of the project. Expecting many refactors. One feature we are done with is the pinging issue with some bugs in the frontend to be resolved.
